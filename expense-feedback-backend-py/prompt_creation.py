    Data of expenses from Bills/Receipts by OCR:
    From the below data recognize amounts, business purpose, transaction date, payment type, city, vendor company name, currency type.

    Rules:
    1. If data from expense form and receipts don't match perfectly and fully, then the expense is not reimbursable so say no and exit here.

    3. Comments are not very important.

    7. If no payment type is provided, default to Cash.
    8. Check for time in the bill. Use common sense to analyze the form and receipt data together. For example, if in bill it's 10:00pm and form data says it's dinner, that's an contradiction.
